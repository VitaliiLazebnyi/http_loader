# Requirements

This document codifies the core architectural specifications and quality standards for the Keep-Alive High-Concurrency Load Testing project.

## Quality & Coverage Mandates
- **[REQ-QUAL-001]** **100% Deterministic Coverage**: All active components MUST be comprehensively tested. The test suite MUST employ determinism (e.g., mocked boundaries, explicit synchronization).
- **[REQ-QUAL-002]** **Zero Regressions**: Any modification MUST yield entirely successful CI runs with zero failing assertions and absolute type-safety.
- **[REQ-QUAL-003]** **Strict Linting**: Default linting mechanisms MUST assert 0 offenses globally without indiscriminate disable pragmas.

## Core Services
- **[REQ-NET-001]** **Asynchronous Epoll/Kqueue Binding**: Client MUST spawn connections within Ruby 4 Epoll/Fiber bound boundaries without blocking the main Thread loop.
- **[REQ-NET-002]** **Deterministic Telemetry API**: The Harness wrapper MUST natively harvest connection and CPU footprints via system tools accurately.
- **[REQ-SRV-001]** **Graceful Disconnect Processing**: Server payloads terminating via `Errno::EPIPE` MUST drop connections mutely without corrupting process memory or stacktracing.

## Client Configuration Parameters
- **[REQ-CLI-001]** **Verbose Logging**: Client MUST support `verbose` configuration to log all TCP connection events, versus strictly errors.
- **[REQ-CLI-002]** **Ping Alive**: Client MUST support a `ping` toggle to dynamically execute HEAD requests inside keep-alive sockets.
- **[REQ-CLI-003]** **Ping Interval**: Client MUST abide by a configuration `ping_period` determining the frequency of pings.
- **[REQ-CLI-004]** **Connection Keep-Alive Timeout**: Client MUST restrict fiber lifetime and forcefully disconnect after `keep_alive_timeout`.
- **[REQ-CLI-005]** **Ratelimiting**: Client MUST securely sequence the initialization of Async tasks strictly via `connections_per_second`.
- **[REQ-CLI-006]** **Total Extent**: Client MUST span strictly exactly `total_connections_per_session` requests in total.
- **[REQ-CLI-007]** **Maximum Concurrency Limit**: Client MUST employ semaphore bounds mapping to `max_concurrent_connections`.
- **[REQ-CLI-008]** **Connection Reopening**: Client MUST seamlessly resurrect dropped TCP streams if `reopen_closed_connections` is toggled.
- **[REQ-CLI-009]** **Reopen Interval Delay**: Client MUST sleep for `reopen_interval` before aggressively restoring faulted TCP sockets.
- **[REQ-CLI-010]** **Read Target Timeout**: Client MUST expose Net::HTTP parameter mappings exactly bounding `read_timeout`.
- **[REQ-CLI-011]** **User Agent Mocking**: Client MUST provide direct string configuration mapping `user_agent` over HTTP traffic payload.
- **[REQ-CLI-012]** **Multi-URL Round-Robin**: Client MUST support multiplexing connections sequentially structured across an array of `--urls`.
- **[REQ-CLI-013]** **Organic Traffic Jitter**: Client MUST inject a ± mathematical randomization factor against sleep boundaries if `--jitter` is provided.
- **[REQ-CLI-014]** **Status Code Telemetry**: Client MUST optionally track and log HTTP upstream payloads when `--track_status_codes` enables non-200 insight.
- **[REQ-CLI-015]** **Ramp Up Simulation**: Client MUST enforce scalable connection ramp-up linearly over time using `--ramp_up`.
- **[REQ-CLI-016]** **IP Multiplexing**: Client MUST optionally bind outgoing sockets sequentially across `--bind_ips` array.
- **[REQ-CLI-017]** **Proxy Tunneling Pools**: Client MUST sequentially map outgoing sockets into proxy connections via `--proxy_pool` URIs.
- **[REQ-CLI-018]** **HTTP Query Throughput**: Client MUST actively transmit HTTP GET queries at `--qps_per_connection` mathematically bypassing passive holding states.
- **[REQ-CLI-019]** **Custom Header Injection**: Client MUST parse and inject arbitrary header hashes recursively into all outbound HTTP logic via `--headers`.
- **[REQ-CLI-020]** **Slowloris Exhaustion**: Client MUST orchestrate byte-by-byte malicious payload distributions mapping delays algorithmically via `--slowloris_delay` entirely skipping standard `Net::HTTP` protocol handlers.
- **[REQ-CLI-021]** **JSON Telemetry Exporter**: Harness MUST format and export final execution telemetry and metrics recursively into a structured JSON file via `--export_json` natively upon completion.
- **[REQ-CLI-022]** **Duration Limiter**: Harness MUST explicitly interrupt and shutdown identically all running test instances systematically via `--target_duration` if explicit limit reached.
- **[REQ-CLI-023]** **Native Parameter Validation**: The interface edges MUST strictly evaluate numeric bounds linearly preventing initialization natively if variables map out of strict mathematical bounds safely.
- **[REQ-SRV-002]** **Strict Log Centralization**: All subsystem logging streams (standard output and error outputs mapping respectively) MUST strictly be aggregated reliably exactly into absolute `./logs/` folder structures natively.
